# Altbrains

Altbrains stands for "Alt Linux Branches Inspector," a command-line utility and shared library that allows you to compare lists of binary packages from different branches of the Alt Linux distribution repository. . It retrieves package lists from the specified branches, performs a comparison, and generates a JSON report containing three sections:

1. 'packages_only_in_source_branch': A list of packages that exist in the first branch but not in the second branch.
2. 'packages_only_in_target_branch': A list of packages that exist in the second branch but not in the first branch.
3. 'packages_with_higher_version_in_source_branch': A dictionary of packages and their respective versions from the first branch that have higher versions than those in the second branch.

The generated 'response.json' file will be placed in the current working directory. The comparison is based on the package names and their version numbers (after removing letters and special characters). Note that this utility requires an active internet connection to access the Alt Linux repository API.

```bash
altbrains -h
```

If the installation was successful, you will see the utility's help information.
## Step 5: Usage

Run the `altbrains` with the desired branch names:

```bash
altbrains sisyphus p10 --arch x86_64
```

This command will compare the lists of binary packages between the `sisyphus` and `p10` branches with `x86_64` architecture, and it will generate the `response.json` file in the current directory.

## Sample Output

After running the command, the `response.json` file will be created with the following structure:
**Warning:** The utility's execution may take several minutes. To reduce waiting time, use the `--arch` flag with the package architecture, e.g., `--arch x86_64`.

```json
{
  "source_branch": "sisyphus",
  "target_branch": "p10",
  "source_packages_count": 1000,
  "target_packages_count": 900,
  "packages_only_in_source_branch": {
    "count": 1,
    "packages": [
      {
        "name": "package1",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "release": "1"
      }
    ]
  },
  "packages_only_in_target_branch": {
    "count": 1,
    "packages": [
      {
        "name": "package2",
        "version": "2.0.1",
        "release": "2"
      }
    ]
  },
  "packages_with_higher_version_in_source_branch": {
    "count": 1,
    "packages": [
      {
        "name": "package3",
        "version": "2.5.0",
        "release": "3"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Uninstalling `altbrains`

If, you want to uninstall `altbrains`, you can use the following `make` command:
